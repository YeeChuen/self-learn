This FriendshipCard project is similar to BasicContactList project.

In Python best practice, 
its is better to have a separate virtual environment that is separate from the local machine.

we can do that by running:

`python -m venv venv`

to activate the virtual environment, do

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

to deactivate active virtual environment, do

`deactivate`

use pip for package management.


rather than writing out requirements one by one, 

use 
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Flask
    --> the framework used in Python

Flask-SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
    --> allow us to connect to a SQL database,
        and map the entries and sequel into a Python object,
        so we can operate on these objet easier

flask-cors
    --> allow us to have cross origin request
    --> for example (JS request --> Python or Python request --> JS)
